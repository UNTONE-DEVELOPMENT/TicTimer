# Conclusion
The TicTimer project started work in January, and I am quite happy with how this app has turned out.
Of course this app wouldn't be possible without the help of Archie (Hubz). Many thanks!
And finally, thanks to you, for your interest in this project. With TicTimer, I aim to help a lot of people, people like me, who would appreciate to see their progress with tic suppression, to see that brighter days are ahead.
